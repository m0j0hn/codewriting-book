description: Your new job as \"Documentation Engineer\" at a SaaS startup fresh out of a much-hyped venture accelerator looks daunting.
---

You're excused for feeling intimidated your first day at DocuMator, the fledgling startup gearing up to soft-launch its eponymous product: a cloud platform for collaboratively writing and publishing product documentation.
Congratulations: you're going to be documenting a product the main users of which are professional tech writers.

DocuMator is a hot company, and you're honored to be joining as a key member of the engineering organization--whether everyone on the team knows it or not.
The good news is that the engineer:tech writer ratio is excellent.

Because docs are beyond critical to this product, DocuMator brought you on relatively early.
The engineering team is only five strong when you join, including the CTO/head engineer, three developers, and a DevOps specialist who will help you integrate your tools with the available infrastructure, which you are not expected to be completely familiar.

[TIP]
What is DocuMator?

On Day One, Shanda Abrams, the Chief Technical Officer and co-founder, reiterates the DocuMator elevator pitch she gave you during your interview.
"DocuMator is a Git-backed content-management system for product documentation.
It looks and feels like a CMS such as WordPress or Drupal, but it uses a flat-file backend and "

Your job, Shanda tells you, is to document their product while establishing the ideal documentation platform and workflow for the soon-to-be-growing engineering team.
There is talk of eventually hiring more tech writers.
"But for at least six months," Shanda says, "you should expect to be it."

Here are the milestones you have agreed to achieve.

. Produce a 1-page HTML user guide to the minimum viable product.
+
This will include:

* account creation
* logging in and out
* creating documents
* publishing content
* managing projects
* various other features

. Choose a source markup language for your primary writing.
+
This challenge will include your first interrogative.
You will choose between:

* Markdown
* AsciiDoc
* reStructuredText
* DITA

. Set up a simple system for sensible, collaborative internal documentation.
+
This will include the second interrogative, which is arguably also the toughest.
You will choose between:

* a cloud portal/intranet/filesystem
* a web-based content management system (CMS)
* a wiki
* flat files in Git
* a hybrid solution

. Set up an integrated "changelog" for DocuMator.
+
This means:

* working with the developers to track the user-facing changes they make;
* copy editing and formatting their notes into presentable shape;
* integrating this source material into the documentation; and
* making sure all release notes appear where and when they should.

. Produce installation instructions for DocuMator Enterprise, the self-serve version of the SaaS product.

.. Test and write up the installation procedure.
+
You're old hat now, so writing up these instructions won't be a big deal.
However, you'll want to reevaluate your approach given each new project's requirements.
And in this case, you'll need to approach the source-info gathering process differently, since you're instructing

* installation (not use)
* to a different audience
* for a different environment.

.. Publish the DocuMator Enterprise installation guide in and HTML and PDF.
+
This won't be a difficult objective, but knowing it is down the pike will inform prerequisite decisions.

. Prepare to hire a second tech writer.
+
This will mean taking some time to evaluate your documentation infrastructure.
Is it ready to accommodate a newcomer?
What is missing?
How can you make it so they'll orientate and contribute rapidly?
