== Writing in Lightweight Markup

You'll pretty much never see a serious software engineer _writing in_ tools that heavily abstract from the code.
There are exceptions to this for complex code, such as formulas and algorithms, which are perhaps better generated automatically than every character written by hand.

== Docs in Flat Files

Another thing you won't find developers doing is keeping all their source code in a relational database.
Typical packaged systems for content management (e.g., Wordpress), contact relationship management (e.g., Salesforce), and task management (e.g., JIRA) use RDB backends.
This is for good reason, as the tools require levels of abstraction that eliminate most user choice.

APIs make CMSes more interesting.

IDEs are basically reverse content management systems for source code.
An IDE is a code editor that is integrated with the software environment.
An IDE "knows" not just the syntax of the language the developer is writing in (catching early generic syntax mistakes and typos);
it is also configured to read variables from files outside the one you're in, as well as apply the rules of that language and environment dynamically.
This helps you test and debug software as you write.

Think of well-configured IDE as spelling and grammar checking on steroids.
Unlike English, computer languages are strict enough that an IDE can give far more accurate insight into code than Word is able to provide.
