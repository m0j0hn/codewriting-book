= Part 5: Evolving

In the final chapters of this book, we'll check in on the recesses of my mind, where I brew insights about innovative ways to improve technical documentation at my organizations.
As with the rise of development frameworks and agile methodologies over the past 15 years, so too can technical documentation enjoy a comparable (if humbly proportionate) renaissance of flourishing methodologies and tooling strategies.
Perhaps DocOps can ride engineering's coat tails into the new way of operating, or we can be left behind as engineers iterate their way to automating our roles entirely.


I fully expect this document to be deprecated in favor of a superior version or alternative post haste; that is a _demand_.
